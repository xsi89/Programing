If you don&#8217;t have a moisture meter use your finger to test the soil.  Surface soil dries out faster in winter, so stick the finger as deeply as you can into the pot without damaging the roots.  </p><p class="bodycal">As with water, you shouldn&#8217;t overfeed your plants in winter. Overloading the soil with too much fertilizer or plant food can burn the root system and stress the plant.  </p><p class="bodycal">As the icy winds of January race down the prairie from Canada the last thing on your mind is plant care, but ignoring your houseplants is a benign death sentence.   </p><p class="bodycal">One of the most common problems with indoor plants in the winter is over watering. You may think that the dry air in your home relates to dry soil, but that&#8217;s not always true.  The weaker winter sun reduces the rate of photosynthesis and plant growth, which equates to lower water use. </p></div></div><div id="main"><div><h1>How <span class="green">Green</span> is Your <span class="blue">Grass</span>? </h1>  <p class="bold">As spring rapidly approaches is your mind turning toward your lawn? Keeping your grass green and healthy without using toxic or harmful chemicals is possible, but it takes some advance planning. </p>  <p class="tocitem"> <img src="images/lawn_fmt.jpeg" /></p> <p>The first thing we ask would-be lawn-care specialists is: What type of grass are you growing? For years, local garden shops have been selling grasses such as Kentucky Blue and other varieties that just aren&#8217;t suited to our long, hot and dry summers. These alien species need more water and fertilizer and don&#8217;t perform well under adverse conditions. Adapted to warmer, wetter climates, they suffer badly from our sub-zero weather when not protected by a thick snow blanket, something we haven&#8217;t seen for a few winters. GreenStart advises members to switch to a grass variety that is native to the region. Of the several species in this group we have several that come highly recommended. <h2>Get Well-Sprung for Spring? </h2>  <p>As the days start getting longer and warmer the need for the window wraps and other temporary insulation is ending, but what do you do with all the plastic waste? Back in October our annual Wrap-Up party instructed members how to insulate their homes in a green-conscious way, minimizing the use of non-recyclable products while maximizing both insulation and energy conservation.  But millions of Americans are still using the cheaper, off-the-shelf products from a variety of manufacturers that rely on non-reusable, non-recycable materials.

As the sun drops the temperature has been known to change by 20 degrees or more! Stay warm and dry by dressing in layers.  </p><p class="bodytips"><span class="boldblue">Mulch Munch &#8211;</span> Believe it or not your mulch bins are active through the winter and require a steady stream of tantalizing tidbits from the table. Continue to feed the mulch all winter and by spring you may have all the natural fertilizer your garden will need. </p><p class="bodytips"><span class="boldblue">Combine Trips &#8211;</span> Plan your car trips each day and combine errands whenever possible to save gas and energy.
