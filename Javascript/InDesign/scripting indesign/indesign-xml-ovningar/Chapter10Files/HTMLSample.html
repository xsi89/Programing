<h1>Typeface Trouble or Font Phobia</h1>

<p>Originally, HTML gave most of the power for displaying the text to the user by way of the browser itself. This was simply because most of the content of the Web in the early days was text&#8212;pages and pages of undifferentiated text&#8212;term papers, theses, government reports and more. So, why not give the user the ability to choose the typeface, font size and color that was the most pleasant and easy to read?</p>

<p>Designers quickly learned that you could override the choices made by the user by judicious application of the code, but with one big caveat. You could choose only typefaces that were already installed on the user's computer! With over 90 million Internet users out there the odds that all or most of them would already have your favorite typeface Peignot&#8482; Std Demi installed on their computers were lower than playing the lottery.</p>

<p>Even today there's not much you can do about this problem other than voluntarily resigning your choices to a list of five to ten typeface that you assume are on most Mac and Windows computers. But this was only the first bitter taste designers got from the Web. The second course was no better.</p>

<h2>Browser Bashing</h2>

<p>Once you think you got HTML and all its variables under your belt, you'll get a dose of reality when you discover that the code and formatting you successfully tested in FireFox works completely differently in Safari, or not at all. And, worse, the differences and variable support for specific codes and formatting not only varies from browser to browser, but it can also vary within different versions of the same program. Egads!


For designers who are used to seeing text and graphics stay in one typeface and position throughout a print design project, it's disconcerting, to say the least, to see carefully formatted text on a Web page fly all over the screen or disappear completely when the page is opened on a new computer. It makes it all the worse when that new computer is in the client's office.


Designers wade into this water hesitantly and with good reason. The Internet is rife with hazards and sinkholes that would claim your entire Web site you're your sanity with equal indifference.


We learned very quickly that although we could override the user's input by simply calling the specific typeface, font size or color using the code, it didn't do us much good. The only fonts you could use for design were the ones already installed on the user's computer! Yep, that's the ugly reality of the Internet.
